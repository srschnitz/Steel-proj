This file added the weather info that I downloaded and merged in to my steel dataset.  It took a lot of cleaning and also matching datetimes.  
There were some missing values and some zeros that will be changed when needed during my analysis.  
Note:  The weather data is not in the exact location of the steelplant.  It is about 30 miles away.
