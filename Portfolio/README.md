# Portfolio Overview

This directory contains portfolio projects and related materials for the Steel-proj repository. Each project showcases different aspects of the work and skills relevant to this repository.
Although, I have links to the gamma presentation Portfolios on the README.md on the Main Branch, I will be loding the pdf of the gamma portfolios and also will be loading hte PowerBI dashboards in the pdf format as well.  
The pdf of gamma, sometimes, does not keep the formats and deletes some of the text, so if there is confusion go to the link I have on the README in the Main.
The pdf of the Powerbi also changes some of the formats and some of the backgrounds are removed and visuals are shrunk.  
As a not on the Powerbi dataframes, they were mainly used for graphics or visuals to add to my porfolios on gamma app.  They are not annontated with much description or how it fits into my analysis.  Some do have some writeups, but not all or most.  
This will dump for most things that are for the porfolios.
